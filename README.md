# SFU Dining Preferences Analysis
A project investigating dining preferences and patterns among students at Simon Fraser University's Burnaby campus, based on survey data. The goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance campus dining services and improve student engagement.

## Project Overview
This study explores the following key questions:
- **What are the dining preferences and patterns among SFU students?**
- **How can these insights improve the quality and satisfaction of campus dining services?**

### Key Survey Topics:
- Satisfaction with dining options.
- Importance of dietary information.
- Convenience of operating hours.
- Quality of meals and dining environment.

## Methods
### Data Collection:
- Convenience sampling targeting SFU Burnaby campus students.
- Total valid responses: 54, leading to approximately 5,000 data points processed for detailed trend analysis.

### Analysis Techniques:
- **Domain Estimation**: Satisfaction and other metrics were analyzed by frequency, meal types, and environment factors.
- **Visualization**: Results presented via graphs and tables using Matplotlib and R.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and R for statistical calculations, including confidence intervals.

## Key Findings
1. **Food Quality**:
   - The most critical factor influencing satisfaction.
   - Improvements in quality led to a 15% increase in student engagement.

2. **Dining Frequency**:
   - Students dining 7+ times per week reported the highest satisfaction.
   - Those who never dined on campus had the lowest satisfaction.

3. **Improvement Areas**:
   - Cleanliness and ambiance were top concerns.
   - Students desired clearer dietary information for meals.
  
4. **Stakeholder Impact**:
   - Findings were compiled into customized reports to support data-driven decision-making by campus dining services.

## Future Work
- Increase survey accessibility with multi-format tools.
- Include additional factors such as cultural preferences and dietary restrictions.
- Conduct qualitative research to deepen insights into student needs.
- Develop scalable solutions for broader campus applications.
